# Platforms to build

In this repository, all tutorials, assignments, information, data can be found for building the platforms.

## How evaluation will take place?

The platforms need to be build on SwitchEngines.
All students should have received an invitation to an associated project.
All projects will be deleted on end of February 2025.
All machines will be switched off at 2am and need to be restartet everytime one might want to work it.

## Access

In this repository, the SSH publickey for the automated solution is placed.
Please add this key to a user with the username `eval`.
The access is mandatory to be graded.
A project where machines are not accessible with a user `eval` and the key stored in the file `access/id_ed25519.pub` can not be evaluated.
It is the students responsibility to ensure access whereas students can demand evaluation of the access from Sebastian Graf.
If the access is not possible because insufficient access (wrong user, key not working) at deadline, the resulting grade will be a `1` for the corresponding platform.

This repository also contains templates for the reports necessary for each platform. The repository can be cloned via
